# Logisim for macOS Catalina and newer

This is an Application Stub for macOS Catalina and newer to run Logisim without installing the old Java Runtime Environment.

### Installation

Logisim requires the Java JDK. I recommend installing it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_de).
After installing Homebrew, download and install Java as a brew cask in your Terminal:

```sh
$ brew cask install java
```

Alternatively, if you are running macOS 11 (Big Sur) and HomeBrew > 2.6.0: 

```sh
$ brew install --cask adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
```

Next, download the [Release-App](https://github.com/LaurensKDev/logisim-macos/releases) and drag it into your Applications folder.

#### Open "Logisim" and enjoy!

### Note
I didn't develop the Logisim app! This is only an Application Stub to run it on macOS Catalina and newer.
